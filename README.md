# Statistical-Analysis-of-Fitness-Equipment-Usage-Data

This case study applies core concepts from Probability and Statistics to explore trends and associations in a fitness equipment company's customer dataset. The analysis was conducted using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.stats).

🔍 Objectives

Understand customer purchase behavior for fitness equipment.

Apply statistical methods to compare subgroups based on demographics and product preferences.

Visualize distributions and test hypotheses about customer segments.

📈 Key Analyses Performed

Descriptive Statistics: Computed measures of central tendency and dispersion across customer demographics and product attributes.

Categorical Analysis: Explored purchase patterns by gender, marital status, product type, and region.

Probability Concepts: Calculated marginal and conditional probabilities for product usage and demographics.

Hypothesis Testing:

- Conducted t-tests and chi-square tests to assess differences in income and product preference across gender and marital status.

- Visual Explorations: Created histograms, boxplots, bar charts, and pie charts for interpretability of trends.
